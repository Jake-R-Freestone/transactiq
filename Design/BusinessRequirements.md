BR1 : This will save time and money for Accutech. <br>
Currently, "the Implementation Services team remaps all existing data to fit our database schemas, which can sometimes take months". As a business the bottom line is to make money or develop your business further. If we can make a tool that can help with the long and painful process of remapping existing data then it will save a lot of time and money. 

BR2 : Makes integrating new systems in the future easier. <br>
This feature will allow for new integrations to be tested, verified, and mapped automatically. If we create a tool that aids in the process of remapping this data and collect the results then we can use these results to further train the machine learning model. If this model becomes confident enough then a portion or even the entire process can be fully automated.
