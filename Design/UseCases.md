## Use Cases

### Actors
* Accutech Employees

### Use Cases
* UC1: Translate data
  * The purpose of the program itself. We need to take incoming data and rework it to fit into the in-house system.
  * Accutech employees would use this.
  * The program automatically maps data to the correct output.
  * This satisfies BR1, as it speeds up the process that employees go through that takes way too much time
* UC2: See data input
  * Displays the data input with data values. This allows the user to see the original unedited data. It also allows direct comparison with the output, to see if the data was mapped correctly.
  * Accutech employees would use this to see where data points were mapped.
  * Users can select a list of data that was just translated, then they press a button to see what the input data for that entry looks like. It is placed side by side with the output data to compare the data.
  * This satisfies BR1 as it allows easy access to the input data so that employees can see where everything is mapped. And BR2, as it allows for human verification.
