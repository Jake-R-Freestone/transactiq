## Front End

For the front end we are using VUE3 which is a javascript framework for web user interfaces. VUE renders components that can be build with calls to the backend. 

## Back End

For the database we are using PostgreSQL which has had a lot of adoption in industry within recent years. Our database api will support CRUD operations and will be developed with the .NET 6 SDK. Our machine learning model will make suggestions to the front end based based on input data from the front end.
