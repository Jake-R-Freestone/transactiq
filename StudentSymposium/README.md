I had a great time at the Symposium! Talking with new people and explaining the project was a lot of fun. I also enjoyed seeing what the other teams in the CS department has spent the last several months working on.
## Jacob Freestone
I think the Student Symposium was an overall great experience. We were able to talk to several people that could look at the project from a different point of view.  Overall the feedback was very positive with a common comment being that our product seems very useful for our client.

I enjoyed my time at the Student Symposium. It felt good being able to talk about the project to others that may have been less technical background or at least not in the computer science major/department. We recieved a lot of good feedback and were able to answer all questions with ease. Also got to see a lot of projects that had words in their titles that I definitely did not know how to pronounce. Overrall a good and enjoyable experience.
