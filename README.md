# TransactIQ

## **Summary**

TransactIQ is a tool that will assist in converting data from outside systems into our proprietary in-house system. When our customers migrate from other systems to ours, our Implementation Services team remaps all existing data to fit our database schemas, which can sometimes take months. TransactIQ will leverage Machine Learning algorithms to map the outside data to the proper in-house format accurately. More specifically, client transaction history, including cash deposits, purchase/selling of securities, or fee payments.
