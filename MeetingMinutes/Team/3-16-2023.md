## Things Clarified

* Next week meet with client to workshop machine learning algorithm

## Topics Discussed

* Discussed Jay working on Vitest and just trying to figure out how to make tests and run it with our project
* Discussed if everything is in order to have small machine learning algorithm into master branch to make sure front-end corresponds correctly
* Discussed how some of the test data is untagged and wondering as to why that is
* Discussed that Chandler will update team on how to setup postgress mock database setup

## Tasks Distributed

* Get front-end tests running worked on by Jay, Chandler

* Clean up front-end design for better, readable code
    * Go back into front-end code and make it easier to add to and read
* Machine Learning worked on by Robert D
    * Developing the machine learning algorithm using tensorflow
* Integration testing worked on by Chandler and Robert M
    * Loading into mock database and creating tests for integration
