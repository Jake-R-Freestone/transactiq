* Asked if the machine learning should look at narrative to assign a better code
* TensorFlow is a big must and we need to get on it to make the Machine Learning dynamic and self learning
* 5th Iteration Requirements:
    * Export functionality to different types of exports like XML or tablaeu
    * Add a help or tool tip
    * Way to translate distance to a confidence score and display on table
