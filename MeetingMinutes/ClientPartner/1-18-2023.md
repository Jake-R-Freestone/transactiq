## Topics Discussed

* Discussed what we had updated on the UI in our software, i.e, added paging and sorting
* Giving us where Cam and Craig which direction they want to go
* Want to get more granular with data, involves adding more fields and indexing tables
* Craig explained how code 121 would be the same as 1201 in cheetah software
* Discussed what categories would be added and narrowing the decision tree
* Discussed transaction category as a decision tree
* Craig showed us what he was conceptually thinking about
* We discussed and he showed the filtered data and what the decision tree would be funneling different categories from the transaction into
* Discussed comparisons for decision tree and what our software would show the user
* Discussed and shown in a write out what they mean for our decision tree and the added possible outcomes
* Discussed someone elses transaction and evaluating their transactions and come to a conclusion to be able to assign to a certain code in Cheetah
* Discussed that we, as a team, have free reign to choose any algorithm to solve this
* Discussed how our project is different from others
* Discussed another functionality feature, if each file upload is done as a interaction so that we can just tab through the data thats already uploaded instead of repetitive uploads of the same data
* Discussed that we need clarification of the heatmap and how it is helpful, Craig said that a heatmap would be helpful if a part of the transactions would be in the same code and said we can make a different type of graph, Chandler suggested a bar chart instead of a heat map to be able to show our outputs and what transactions would be funneled into
* The heat map would have 6 major groups and inside the groups there are different potential variance
* Craig showed us what his idea was for code mapping was
* Discussed when or if we are able to get outside data to be able to play with data similar to actual user data


## Things Clarified

* Discussed some features for future iterations like a more definite and logical decision tree with machine learning
* To do by end of this iteration and if not then to add to next iteration: tabbing, bar graphing, and extension of the decision tree to be done by end of this iteration
* Plan on having an update meeting next wednesday to see what we have done so far
