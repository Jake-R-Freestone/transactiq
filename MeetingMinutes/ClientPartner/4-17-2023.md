## Client Use of the Project

* Cam demoed out project
* Cam took control over Teams and used our project while we watched
* Cam tested all the buttons and features and was able to export to his desired file type
* it took about 5 minutes maybe less to run through how software
* They really liked it and liked color schemes of things and how it really fits with company colors
* There was a white highlight box that we should get rid of and also the placement of buttons can definitely be improved before submittion
* During the demo, no issues

## Topics Discussed

* Both Craig and Cam like it so far but the highlight box and layout need some reaarranging
* Discussed the handoff with Cameron and how we should help with it being an easier transition
* Cam said a install and setup video would be beneficial and does not expect anything to complicated
* Considered copying files from github to bitbucket or just add a link to github for user documentation
* Discussed the real estate of buttons and the button titles so that it is easier to follow
* Discussed how algorithm is going to learn from user decisions to learn from users
